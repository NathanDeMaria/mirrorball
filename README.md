# Python Project Template

Project template I use for my little Python projects. Includes:

- [VSCode remote container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) setup
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management
- My favorite devtools:
  - `pytest` for testing
  - `black` for formatting
  - `pylint` and `mypy` as "linters" (yes, you can have both, and they handle separate needs)
- Some `git` aliases I like

## Usage

[Install the `copier` CLI](https://github.com/copier-org/copier/tree/93d95a6a7bda7ac3bc201356e63e7cfacd810dad#installation) if you don't have it already

```
copier gh:NathanDeMaria/mirrorball .
